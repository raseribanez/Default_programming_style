# Default_Programming_Format
How I propose to start off, and write my own programs

By sticking to a continuous theme across my programs, my code will be easy 
to read and understand. However when starting off and progressing, I have used
a variety of fashions as I find my preferences so it may take some time to go
 back over all of my code to add a constant formatting style

This might seem a little OCD to some, but in the wise words of Tim Peters:
Readability Counts. A line from the Zen of Python Poem (Shell/import this)

My writing preferences are as follows:


    Comments: NO More than 80 characters per line.
    Function Comments: Triple quotes tp open and close (not started this yet).
    Variables: thisMethod not this_method. (thisMethod = something)
    Functions: this_method not thisMethod. (def this_method)
    Printing: Less is more, if parenthesis not required...dont add them. (print"Less is More")
    

As you can see not too complex yet - as I find myself preferring/using certain methods I will update
 this list
 
If you see any issues with the way I do something please let me know (eg If my methods will cause problems later on)
