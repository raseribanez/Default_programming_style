# THIS ISNT A PROGRAM
# Just a visual demonstration of my formatting preferences across code
#
# THIS WONT APPLY SO STRICTLY OVER MY TUTORIAL CODING, AS i WANT READABILITY TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT
# THING, SOMETIMES A BIT OF EXTRA SPACING CAN MAKE THINGS EASIER ON THE EYE


# FUNCTIONS
def this_method(): # How I write function definitions

# VARIABLES
thisMethod = something # How I name Variables (No_Underscore - for easy recognition as a variable)

# PRINTING
print"This Method"  # Instead of print("This Method") Not using parentheses if not required

# COMMENTS
# Comments (#) No longer than 80 characters per line, written in proper, understandable English

# Sentences start with Upper case char unless used to comment out a line of code

# Removing code for testing purposes # Using this comment method with a brief line-above-comment explaining the codes purpose

# PARENTHESES SPACING
# (one,two three,four) and (1,2,3,4) indstead of (1, 2, 3, 4) so, without spaces

# (10+10), not (10 + 10)
